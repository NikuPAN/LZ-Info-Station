Notes for Devs:

Please modfity the UI by making changes only inside "frontend" folder.

Any change to frontend UI please update "backend/build" as well. To do this:
  1.  In "frontend" folder, run command "npm run build" to create a build version of this application.
  2.  Copy the created "build" folder to "backend", please delete the old version prior to paste the new version.
  3.  Push your changes to github, ask project owner/designated developer(s) to review your work before you push your changes into master branch, 
  the best way is to create your own branch then merge changes into master branch.
  4.  Done.
